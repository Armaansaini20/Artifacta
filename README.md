Artifacta is an AI-powered platform that transforms **2D images into interactive 3D models** using advanced generative AI and depth-estimation techniques.

---

## 📌 Overview

Artifacta simplifies 3D content creation by allowing users to upload a single 2D image and receive a fully generated 3D mesh.  
The platform leverages AI-based depth estimation and mesh generation, delivering real-time previews directly in the browser.
